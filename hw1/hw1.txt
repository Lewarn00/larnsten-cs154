Question 1 

foo = 1;
endian = !(*(char *) &foo);

This solution assigns a value of 1 to int foo. The first byte of the integer is then retrieved by casting the address as a char pointer. This byte is 0 in a big-endian machine and 1 in a little-endian machine. 

Question 2

A. !!x
B. !!~x
C. !!(x & 0xF)
D. !!(x & 0xAAAAAAAA)
E. !!(~(x >> (4 + 8 * (sizeof(x) - 1))) & 0xF)
