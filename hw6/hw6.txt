Quesiton 1

A. Yes, P1 will be loaded into address range 0-2.
B. Yes, P2 will be loaded into address range 6-8.
C. Since address 5 is already in use, the only open addresses are 3, 4, and 9. Thus, there is no open block of 3MB to load P3.
D. The internal fragmentation for P1 is 2MB (since P1 requires 1MB), P2 is 1MB (since P2 requires 2MB), and P3 is n/a. Therefore, the total internal fragmentation is 3MB. 
E. The addresses 3, 4, and 9 cannot be used, resulting in 3MB of external fragmentation.

Question 2

A.
Access &                                       Physical  Success

r 0xF4 = 1 |  1110100 ;  0x13   +    0x74   =  0x87     (S)
w 0x38 = 0 |  0111000 ;  0x9A   +    0x38   =  0xD2     (E)
r 0x12 = 0 |  0010010 ;  0x9A   +    0x12   =  0xAC     (S)

B. Since the computer provides 8-bit addressing and 1 bit is used for the segment bit, the largest possible size of a segment is 2^7 bytes.
